The beauty of it we cannot now fully comprehend; but, as we gaze on it, we may say in the words of Michael Angelo:—</p></blockquote><pre>“Souls burn for souls—spirits to spirits cry,
I seek the splendour in thy fair face storèd;
Yet living man that beauty scarce can learn,
And he who fain would find it first must die.”</pre></div> </div>
