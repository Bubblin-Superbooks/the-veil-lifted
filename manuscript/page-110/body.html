The first of the negatives which was printed off disclosed our boy sitting up in bed, just in the place where he died, and although, as I have said, his face is more spiritualised, and not so chubby as when in earth life three years ago, yet there is not the least doubt in our minds that it is our loved and lost one as he is now on the other side. The second photograph discloses him as clothed in a boy’s suit, and sitting on his mother’s knee. Here also the face is quite human-looking, and just our son as he looked about the close of his sharp and severe illness. The likeness in all the photographs is essentially the same. Over the figure in each photograph is a beautiful star, and the whole experiment has been a phenomenal success in spirit photography, besides being a source of great joy to us all.</p></div> </div>
