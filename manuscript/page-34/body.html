Here is something  to which believers in the visibility of spirit forms to a camera are quite welcome. At the time, and <em>àpropos</em> of the Mumler trial in New York, I wrote that a good many absurd things have been said <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em> on the subject; but a writer in the latter category, who asserted that anything that is visible to the eye of the camera, and thus capable of being depicted by photography, must therefore necessarily be visible to the human eye, was surely ignorant of that important branch of physics popularly known as fluorescence.

Why, for that matter, a room (visually dark) may be full of the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum, and a photograph may be taken in that dark light.
